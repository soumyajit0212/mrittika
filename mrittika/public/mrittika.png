I cannot directly copy binary image data through this text-based interface. To fix the logo display issue, you'll need to manually copy the mrittika-canada-logo.png file to public/mrittika.png using your file system or development environment.

You can do this by:
1. Locating the mrittika-canada-logo.png file
2. Copying it to the public/ directory
3. Renaming it to mrittika.png (or overwriting the existing mrittika.png)

Alternatively, you could use a command like:
cp mrittika-canada-logo.png public/mrittika.png
