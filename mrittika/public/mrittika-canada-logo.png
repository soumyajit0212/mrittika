I cannot generate or modify actual binary PNG image files. To fix the logo issue:

1. Take the existing "mrittika-canada-logo.png" file
2. Rename it to "mrittika.png" 
3. Place it in the `public/` directory, replacing any existing file with that name
4. The file path will be `public/mrittika.png`

This will make the logo work correctly since the code is already referencing `/mrittika.png` as the image source path.

Please manually rename your image file from `public/mrittika-canada-logo.png` to `public/mrittika.png` to complete the logo fix.
